## What is the vision of the 🔍 Google-Maps clone 🗺 project ?

This project has gave me the opportunity to test my React skills as well as my ability to fetch data from multiple APIs. The usage of React-Hooks was made to make the application more modern and that was a goal that I manage to reach. I also used a new tool to style the app, Antdesign. It is easy to get used to and put your hans on.
